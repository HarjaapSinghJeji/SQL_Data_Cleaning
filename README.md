# SQL_Data_Cleaning
In this project, I will focus on data cleaning using SQL. Data cleaning is a highly valuable skill in the data analyst community, as it involves transforming and preparing raw data for analysis.

The purpose of this project is to showcase my proficiency in SQL and my ability to effectively clean and preprocess data. Throughout the project, I will work with a dataset and perform various data cleaning tasks using SQL queries.

**Project** **Steps**
Understanding the Dataset: I will start by exploring the raw dataset (data.xlsx) to understand its structure, variables, and identify any data quality issues that need to be addressed.

Creating the Database: Next, I will create a database in my  SQL server management system to work with the dataset.

Loading the Dataset: I will import the raw dataset (data.xlsx) into the database, ensuring that the table schema matches the structure of the dataset.

Data Cleaning: Using SQL queries, I will perform the following data cleaning tasks:

Removing duplicate records.
Handling missing values.
Standardizing and validating data formats.
Correcting data inconsistencies.
Removing unnecessary columns.
Transforming data for analysis.
